<div class= "info-1"><p>Burgoyne Bridge is located in downtown St Catherines and hangs over the 406. </p></div>

<div class= "info-2"><p>In October a nineteen year old man and a 43 year old man both died six days apart, each taking their own life by jumping off the bridge. This has sprung a movement in St Catherines with the community holding memorials to the fallen, adding encouraging and thoughtful messages  on the bridge and most importantly urging better solutions for mental health in the Niagara Region.
The region has proposed a solution in the form of a barrier to be built around the bridge. While studies may have shown barriers can help in suicide prevention, can that be the only solution?</p></div>

<div class= "info-3"><p>Statistics Canada said in the latest period available, 2008-2012, there were 222 deaths by suicide in Niagara. Of these 18.2 per cent resulted from hanging, 9.8 per cent from drug overdoses, 3.8 per cent from falls from heights, 3.2 per cent from chemical overdoses, three per cent from firearms and 1.8 per cent from sharp or blunt objects.</p></div>
<div class= "info-final"><p>We need a complete solution. We need to be there for our community when they need it most.</p></div>
